=== Comparing Feature Selection Methods ===

--- Testing tree selection method ---

=== Using Tree-based Feature Selection ===
Selected 6 features out of 613
Selected features:
- Time
- Length
- Airline_WN
- DayOfWeek_2
- DayOfWeek_4
- DayOfWeek_7
Average F1 score: 0.6236 (±0.0011)

--- Testing f_test selection method ---

=== Using ANOVA F-test Feature Selection ===
Selected 6 features out of 613
Selected features:
- Time
- Airline_FL
- Airline_US
- Airline_WN
- Airline_YV
- AirportFrom_MDW
Average F1 score: 0.6019 (±0.0011)

--- Testing mutual_info selection method ---

=== Using Mutual Information Feature Selection ===
Selected 6 features out of 613
Selected features:
- Time
- Length
- Airline_WN
- DayOfWeek_3
- DayOfWeek_4
- DayOfWeek_5
Average F1 score: 0.6206 (±0.0008)

--- Testing rfe selection method ---

=== Using Recursive Feature Elimination ===
Selected 6 features out of 613
Selected features:
- Time
- Airline_WN
- DayOfWeek_2
- DayOfWeek_4
- DayOfWeek_5
- DayOfWeek_6
Average F1 score: 0.5990 (±0.0005)

Best selection method: Tree-based (F1 = 0.6236)

Feature overlap between different methods:
ANOVA F-test and Tree-based: 2/6 features in common
ANOVA F-test and Mutual Information: 2/6 features in common
ANOVA F-test and RFE: 2/6 features in common
Mutual Information and Tree-based: 4/6 features in common
Mutual Information and RFE: 4/6 features in common
RFE and Tree-based: 4/6 features in common

Recommended approach: Use 'tree' feature selection with features: ['Time' 'Length' 'Airline_WN' 'DayOfWeek_2' 'DayOfWeek_4' 'DayOfWeek_7']
